We have created a map showing the Milan’s districts, with a popup for each one indicating:
- price per m2
- presence of graffiti 

The amount of visual pollution is calculated as the number of visual pollution pixels compared to the total of images for each districts. The results were converted in a more user friendly way:

☆☆☆☆☆ From bad
★★★★★ To excellent


To have a more significant result we add a street map showing density of graffiti. This leads user to see the best street of each zone.
